# OneFlow: Plan to Bill in One Place 🚀

## 💡 The Problem Statement

**OneFlow** is a modular Project Management system designed to solve a critical real-world business challenge:  
the **fragmentation between project execution and financial tracking**.

Project managers and finance teams often rely on separate tools for:

- **Planning:** Tasks, timelines, and resource allocation.  
- **Execution:** Time logging, status updates, and blocker tracking.  
- **Finance/Billing:** Creating Sales Orders (revenue), recording Purchase Orders (costs), generating Customer Invoices, and managing Expenses.

This separation leads to **delayed billing**, **inaccurate profitability analysis**, and **wasted time reconciling data**.  
Our goal is to **unify this entire workflow**.

## ⚙️ Core Solution

**OneFlow** allows a Project Manager to take a project from **Planning → Execution → Billing** within a single interface,  
providing **real-time visibility into Revenue, Cost, and Profit per project.**

## 🎯 Why We Chose This Challenge (Our Motivation)

We selected the **“Plan to Bill”** problem for this hackathon because it offers a unique blend of **technical** and **business logic** complexity.  
It moves beyond standard applications to tackle a **core Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** workflow.

- **Real-World Impact:**  
  This project addresses a fundamental pain point for consulting firms and agencies.  
  It required us to implement crucial real-world business logic, understanding how different organizational modules  
  (**Projects ↔ Sales ↔ Purchases ↔ Accounting**) communicate seamlessly.

- **Skill Development:**  
  It provided an excellent opportunity to learn how to structure data and relationships —  
  for example, linking a **Timesheet** or an **Expense** directly to cost and revenue calculations —  
  to maintain financial accuracy in a live system.
